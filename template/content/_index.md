## A Global Alliance for Sharing Cybersecurity Data
The OCA brings together vendors and end users in an open cybersecurity
ecosystem where products can freely exchange information, insights,
analytics, and orchestrated response. The OCA supports commonly
developed code and tooling and the use of mutually agreed upon
technologies, data standards, and procedures.
